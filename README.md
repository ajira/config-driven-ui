# Config Driven UI

Intent of this project is to build UI based on configurations passed from backend. 

The configs can be checked in [sample config](./src/config/PageFormat.js).


## TODOs

1. Associate components to each part of the UI split
2. Make spacing ( vertical and horizontal) config driven
3. Remove any hard coded styles and pass it as configs as well 
4. Make it into a distributable / versionable library.
